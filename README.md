# Beeline: The Random Picker

This is a simple web app that randomly picks an option out of a list. It is written in vue.js as a single page application. It is purely a client-side app with no back-end interactions. It saves the data to the browser's local storage.

I made this app to learn vue.js as well as make a random picker for what movie to watch for movie nights and what restaurant to eat at with other people.
